## [0.4.4] - 2025-12-28

### **Added**

* **Surgical ADIF Parser**: Implemented a length-aware internal parser (`parse_adif_internal`) that accurately extracts data based on ADIF tag length headers, improving reliability over standard regex splits.
* **ADIF 3.1.6 Authority**: Added tool-based access to authoritative 3.1.6 specification resources, including field definitions and enumerations.
* **Resource Bundling**: Updated build configuration to explicitly include ADIF specification JSON files within the package wheel.

### **Changed**

* **Async Migration**: Refactored core server tools to `async` to support high-performance I/O operations and compatibility with `aiofiles`.
* **Test Suite Modernization**: Migrated the test suite to `pytest-asyncio` with explicit loop scope configuration to ensure stability in CI/CD environments.
* **MCP Content Handling**: Updated tests to correctly index and verify `TextContent` objects returned by the FastMCP tool wrapper.

### **Fixed**

* **Linting & Type Safety**: Resolved 16 high-priority **Ruff** and **mypy** errors, including unused imports (`F401`), module-level import positioning (`E402`), and redundant type casts.
* **Undefined Name**: Replaced the undefined `is_numeric` helper with a robust regex-based number validator for field specification checks.
* **CI/CD Configuration**: Fixed a critical `INTERNALERROR` (Exit Code 3) in GitHub Actions caused by unset `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope`.
* **Path Resolution**: Fixed relative path logic in `get_spec_text` to ensure resources are findable regardless of the installation directory.

## [v0.3.6] — 2025-09-05

### Added
- New `adif-mcp validate-manifest` subcommand (now in `cli/validate.py`) to check `mcp/manifest.json` against bundled JSON schema.
- Credentials management CLI (`adif-mcp creds …`) with keychain/keyring storage; supports `username+password` and `api_key`.
- Persona date-ranged callsign support (e.g., legacy calls merged by providers, user-facing ranges for reporting).

- Streaming NDJSON path: typed error records, memory-friendly iteration, correct stats accounting.
- Mypy/ruff/interrogate hygiene across CLI modules (complete type hints, docstrings, line length ≤ 90).

### Developer Experience
- `make gate` validates schema, runs lint/type/doc checks, and performs keychain smoke test on macOS.
- New script: `scripts/make-lean-archive.sh` to output `dist/*.tar.gz` and `dist/*.zip` with essential files.

---

## [0.3.5] - 2025-09-03
### Added
- CLI now exposes `validate-manifest` as a first-class command.
- `Makefile` updated to run `uv run adif-mcp validate-manifest` for consistency.

### Changed

- Tests updated to use the new CLI structure.
- Manifest validation tests improved with fallback shape checks (ensures `tools` array exists).

### Fixed
- Missing `__version__` and `__adif_spec__` exports in `adif_mcp.__init__.py`.
- MyPy typing issues in manifest tests and CLI tests.

---

## [0.3.4] - 2025-09-02
### Changed:

  - Added new target to Makefile: validate-manifest.

### Removed
  - Removed old bootstrap Makefile target for manifest.

### Optional CLI eQSL Stub ( demo / test functions )
```bash
      Commands for the (stub) eQSL integration.

      These commands exercise the manifest-defined tools without calling the real
      eQSL.cc service. Useful for wiring, demos, and end-to-end testing.

    Options:
      --version  Show the version and exit.
      --help     Show this message and exit.

    Commands:
      inbox    Return a deterministic stubbed 'inbox' for the given user.
      summary  Summarize QSO records by band or mode (stub data).
    - Verified Green for ruff, mypy, and interrogate
```
---

---

## [0.3.3] - 2025-09-02
### Fixed
- Ensure manifest.json is included in dist aand wheel.

---

## [0.3.2] - 2025-09-02
### Fixed
- Ensured `manifest-validate` works reliably in both local and packaged installs by updating `cli.py` to prefer the packaged `src/adif_mcp/mcp/manifest.json` and gracefully fallback to repo manifests.
- Cleaned up CI configuration:
  - Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run manifest validation inline with other gates.
  - Corrected paths and logic in `manifest-validate.yml` workflow.

### Changed
- Removed redundant manifest validation logic; consolidated to `adif-mcp manifest-validate` for consistency across local, CI, and release builds.

- New `adif_mcp.identity` namespace with clear separation of:
  - `models` (Persona, ProviderRef types)
  - `store` (JSON persistence)
  - `secrets` (keyring integration)
  - `manager` (high-level PersonaManager with typed errors)
  - `errors` (granular exception classes for credential handling)

- `src/adif_mcp/resources/` module introduced:
  - `providers/*.json` for per-provider field definitions
  - `schemas/manifest.v1.json` for manifest validation

- CI and pre-commit updated to enforce `ruff`, `mypy --strict`, and `interrogate` across the new layout.

### Removed
- Legacy `scripts/` helpers (`http_probe.py`, `provider_index_probe.py`, etc.) now fully replaced by `adif_mcp.probes.*`.
- Old `mcp/` provider/spec folders replaced by `resources/`.
- Deprecated direct imports from `adif_mcp.personas` / `persona_manager`.

### Notes
- This release introduces **breaking changes** for anyone importing directly from `adif_mcp.personas` or `persona_manager`.
- Downstream users should migrate to the `adif_mcp.identity` namespace.

---

---

## [0.1.21] - 2025-08-31
### Added
- Introduced **PersonaManager** as the single point of truth for personas, providers, and secrets.
- New script: `provider_index_probe.py` consolidates the old `eqsl_inbox_probe.py` and `provider_inbox_probe.py`.
- `make keychain-test` target now exercises persona add/set/remove flows against macOS Keychain safely.
- Extended pyproject.toml:
  - Defined `[project.optional-dependencies]` groups for dev tooling (ruff, mypy, pytest, interrogate, mkdocs, etc.).
  - Added provider URLs (LoTW, eQSL, Club Log, QRZ) under `[project.urls]`.
  - Config section `[tool.adif]` now OS-agnostic (`config_dir_name`, `personas_index`).
- Makefile:
  - Added consistent `gate` and `smoke-all` targets with `uv run` for lint, type, test, interrogate.
  - Added `docs-check` and `docs-dev` helpers for MkDocs/Mermaid workflows.

### Changed
- All persona/provider/secret resolution now routed through **PersonaManager**.

- Type safety improvements:
  - Removed redundant `cast()` calls, eliminated `Any` return paths.
  - Added full docstrings and typing to PersonaManager and helpers.
- Consolidated/de-duplicated Makefile `smoke-all` target (removed `scripts/smoke.sh`).
- UI (`persona_ui.py`) removed from repo and stashed for later revisit.

### Fixed
- `make gate` and `make smoke-all` now fully green (ruff, mypy strict, interrogate, pytest).
- MacOS keychain test: fixed handling of `security(1)` return codes when no items remain.
- Pre-commit and CI config aligned with strict typing and lint rules.

### Notes
- This version is **tagged only** (v0.1.21) and not intended for release packaging.
- Breaking change: the following scripts were removed in favor of consolidation:
  - `eqsl_inbox_probe.py`
  - `provider_inbox_probe.py`

---

## [0.1.20] - 2025-08-30
### Added
- Persona CLI enhancements:
  - `persona add`, `persona list`, `persona show`, `persona remove`, and `persona remove-all`.
  - Support for managing provider credentials via system keyring.
  - Validation: reject end date earlier than start date.
  - Automatic normalization of callsigns to uppercase.
  - Improved `persona list` output with optional `--verbose` mode (masks usernames).
  - Keyring backend is echoed when saving credentials.
- New `make keychain-test` target to manually validate persona/credential round-trips (safe for local testing).

### Fixed
- Consistent error handling in CLI commands (`remove`, `remove-all`, etc.).
- Mypy and Ruff compliance across `adif-mcp/{src,scripts,test} `.
- Gate and smoke tests now pass cleanly with real macOS Keychain integration.

### Notes
- This release marks the first complete integration of **Personas** with secure credential storage.
